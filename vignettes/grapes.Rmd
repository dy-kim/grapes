The `grapes` package turns arbitrary functions into binary operators. As with the [magrittr pipe](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html), you can avoid cumbersome parentheses this way.

```{r}
library(grapes)
grapes(rbind, c, from = "base") # Use `from` to specify a package or environment to search. 
nrow(sleep) 
longer = sleep %rbind% sleep %rbind% sleep
nrow(longer)
1 %rbind% 2 %c% 3
```

In your workspace, you can define your own functions for your operators. That way, there is no need to set the `from` argument to tell `grapes()` where to look.

```{r}
myop <- function(x, y){
  1/x + 1/y
}
grapes(myop)
2 %myop% 3
```

**Operators are left-associative!**

```{r}
2 %myop% 3 %myop% 4
(2 %myop% 3) %myop% 4
2 %myop% (3 %myop% 4)
```


Optionally, you can go crazy and try to turn everything from a package or environment into an operator. But be warned: for packages, only exported functions will become usable operators. Also, `grapes()` automatically loads the package you specify, but `ls("package:...")` requires that you load the package first.

```{r}
library(knitr) # needed for the next line
suppressWarnings( # not everything in knitr is an exported function
  grapes(list = ls("package:knitr"), from = "knitr") # same as objects("package:knitr")
)
`%purl%`
```

Advanced users can supply environments to the `from` and `to` arguments. This affords more control over where the functions come from and where the operators get assigned.

```{r}
to_env = new.env()
from_env = new.env()
from_env$nextop = function(a, b, extra = 3){
  sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + extra
}
assign_operator = function(){
  grapes(nextop, from = from_env, to = to_env)
}
assign_operator()
# 1 %nextop% 2 # throws an error since %nextop% is not defined in your workspace
eval(parse(text = "1 %nextop% 2"), envir = to_env)
```
